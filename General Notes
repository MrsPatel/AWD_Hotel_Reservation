        The routes are based on the components in the models. 

React Components 
    React updates and re-renders components 
    Component takes paramerters called props 
        This creates a hierarchy of views called the render method 
        The render method returns a list of things (html/jsx) you want to see on the screen 


Example 
class ShoppingList extends React.Component{
    render(){
        return (
            <div className = "shopping-list">
                <h1>Shopping list for {this.props.name}</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cereal</li>
                    <li>Milk</li>
                    <li>Bananas</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
//Sytax is JSX which is similar to HTML
// Example usage: <ShoppingList name name="Beau" />
//HTML uses class, JSX uses class name

//index.html page is what loads when we go to the website 
    div id=root is where the react app loads

//index.js is the JS that loads with out page 
//App.js is the main stuff we have on our home page 

The .jsx is being returned from App.js which gets loaded into the HTML from index.js

React router makes it easier to route different URL's to react components

All react components start like this: 
export default class Navbar extends Component{
    render(){
        return(
            html 
        )
    }
}

We wil;l be using bootrstap

NPM install react-datepicker

connect front end and backend by causing f/e to send http requests to the backend
