# AWD_Hotel_Reservation
The project is all about Hotel Reservation System. The goal of this project is to provide an online hotel reservation service to customers. The website will consist of an option for the user to select the check-in/check-out date, how many guests will be staying, as well as a zipcode as to where they are trying to book the hotel. Once all this information has been entered, the website will display options based on the availability, pricing, and hotel rating?? The customers will be able to easily select which hotel fits their needs. Once a selection is made, the customers can view details about the hotels as well as make a selection on the type of room they are interested in staying in based on the details provided on that specific room (max occupancy, outside view, price, images). Once the decision has been made, customers can easily make reservations as well as cancel an existing reservation. Once the reservation has been selected, they will have the option to make a payment/advance payment through PayPal.Reminders will be sent as their check-in date gets closer. Each time a reservation has been made, the room status will be updated in the hotels’ database so multiple parties do not book the same room.

## To run the app 
Download locally. 
The name of the app currently is mern-todo-app
```text
  cd mern-todo-app 
  npm start
```
This will automatically kick off your browser http://localhost:5000 
nodemon package automatically restarts the node application when file changes in the directory are detected. 
##
Using mongo DB atlas to have Mongo in the cloud. We will need to white list out IP addresses. Under network acccess. DB users must be created under DB Access. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
