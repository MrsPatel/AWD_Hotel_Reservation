# AWD_Hotel_Reservation
The project is for a COSC 617 project Hotel Reservation System. The goal of this project is to provide an online hotel reservation service to customers. The website will consist of an option for the user to select the check-in/check-out date, how many guests will be staying, as well as a zipcode as to where they are trying to book the hotel. Once all this information has been entered, the website will display options based on the availability, pricing, and hotel rating?? The customers will be able to easily select which hotel fits their needs. Once a selection is made, the customers can view details about the hotels as well as make a selection on the type of room they are interested in staying in based on the details provided on that specific room (max occupancy, outside view, price, images). Once the decision has been made, customers can easily make reservations as well as cancel an existing reservation. Once the reservation has been selected, they will have the option to make a payment/advance payment through PayPal.Reminders will be sent as their check-in date gets closer. Each time a reservation has been made, the room status will be updated in the hotelsâ€™ database so multiple parties do not book the same room.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
